## 🧠 How It Works

1. Tasks are stored in `localStorage` under the key `tasks`.
2. On page load, tasks are dynamically rendered as styled cards.
3. The search input filters tasks live, showing a fallback message if none match.
4. Sidebar toggles visibility with the hamburger icon.
5. Profile image and other UI elements adjust based on screen size.
